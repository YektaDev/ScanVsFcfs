# Comparison of SCAN and FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithms

This Kotlin-based project serves as a simulation platform for evaluating the **SCAN** and **FCFS** disk scheduling
algorithms, aiming to provide a comparison between the two. The simulation offers both a **manual-input** mode and a
**random-input** mode, facilitating extensive testing, especially for large-scale random scenarios. This initiative is a
component of the coursework for the *Implementation of Database Systems* at Yazd University.

For an in-depth understanding of the topic and access to the benchmark results, please refer to the
included [report](Report%20-%20SCAN%20vs%20FCFS.pdf).
